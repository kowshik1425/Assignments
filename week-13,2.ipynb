    "Overfitting:Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise, outliers, and minor fluctuations in the data rather than just the underlying patterns. As a result, the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",
    "Consequences: The primary consequence of overfitting is poor generalization. When the model encounters new data, it is likely to make inaccurate predictions or classifications because it has essentially memorized the training data rather than learned meaningful relationships.\n",

    "Reducing overfitting in machine learning is essential to ensure that a model generalizes well to new, unseen data.

    "Regularization:Apply regularization techniques to penalize overly complex models. \n",
