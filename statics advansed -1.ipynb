    "Point Estimate:\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value or point that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter. It is typically calculated from sample data and serves as the best guess or approximation of the true parameter value.\n",
    "Point estimates are often calculated using sample statistics that are known to be unbiased estimators of the population parameter. For example, the sample mean (is commonly used as a point estimate of the population mean and the sample proportion is used as a point estimate of the population proportion\n",

    "\n",
    "Interval Estimate:\n",
    "An interval estimate, also known as a confidence interval, provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie, along with a level of confidence associated with the interval.\n",
    "Interval estimates are constructed around point estimates and take into account the variability in the sample data. They provide a measure of uncertainty about the point estimate by specifying a range of plausible values for the population parameter.\n",
    "The width of the confidence interval depends on several factors, including the sample size, variability of the data, and chosen level of confidence (e.g., 95% confidence interval).\n",
    "Confidence intervals are often constructed using the point estimate plus or minus a margin of error, which is determined based on the standard error of the estimate and the chosen level of confidence.\n"

    "Student's t-distribution, often referred to simply as the t-distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped, similar to the normal distribution. However, it has heavier tails, which means it has more probability in the tails and less in the center compared to the normal distribution. The shape of the t-distribution depends on a parameter called the degrees of freedom (df).\n",
    "The t-distribution is used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small (typically less than 30). It arises from the fact that the sample standard deviation is used to estimate the population standard deviation, which introduces additional variability in the sampling distribution.\n",
    "When to use the t-distribution:\n",
    "Small sample sizes: When the sample size is small (typically less than 30), the t-distribution is used instead of the normal distribution to account for the increased variability introduced by using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation.\n",
