    "Comparing models with different numbers of predictors: When you're evaluating multiple regression models that have varying numbers of independent variables, using regular R-squared can be misleading. Since R² tends to increase with more variables, a model with excessive predictors might have a higher R² simply due to chance or overfitting. Adjusted R-squared penalizes models with more variables, providing a fairer comparison for models with different complexities.\n",

    "Effect: The L1 penalty term in Lasso tends to shrink some coefficients towards zero. In some cases, coefficients can even become exactly zero, effectively removing those variables from the model. This feature selection aspect of Lasso helps to reduce model complexity and potentially improves generalizability by focusing on the most relevant variables.\n",

    "Effect: The L2 penalty in Ridge regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero but typically doesn't eliminate them entirely.

However, unlike Lasso, it doesn't perform variable selection by setting coefficients to zero."

    "1. The Cost Function:Linear regression models typically minimize a cost function that measures the difference between the predicted values and the actual values (often the mean squared error).\n",
    "2. The Regularization Penalty:Regularization techniques add a penalty term to this cost function. This penalty term discourages the model from having overly large coefficients (values assigned to predictor variables). There are different types of regularization penalties, but two common ones are L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization (discussed in Q6).\n",
    "3. The Impact of Regularization:\n",
    "Lasso Regularization (L1 penalty): This penalty term is based on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. By minimizing the cost function with this penalty, the model is forced to keep the sum of absolute coefficients small. This can lead to some coefficients becoming exactly zero, effectively removing those variables from the model. This process acts as feature selection, focusing the model on the most important variables and reducing its complexity.\n",
    "Ridge Regularization (L2 penalty): This penalty term is based on the sum of the squared values of the coefficients. Minimizing the cost function with this L2 penalty shrinks the coefficients towards zero but doesn't eliminate them entirely. This reduces the overall influence of individual variables, making the model less sensitive to specific features and potentially reducing overfitting.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Imagine you're building a model to predict house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Without regularization, the model might try to fit the training data perfectly, even capturing random noise in specific features. This could lead to the model assigning high importance to an outlier data point with an unusually high price or a specific neighborhood with a temporary price fluctuation.\n",
    "Regularization helps to prevent this by penalizing models with overly large coefficients. This discourages the model from overfitting to specific features in the training data and encourages it to focus on capturing the more general relationships between the features and the target variable (house price)."

    "Regularized linear models, while powerful tools for combating overfitting in regression analysis, do have some limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Underlying assumption issues:\n",
    "Linearity: Regularized linear models assume a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. If the underlying relationship is non-linear, regularization might not be effective in capturing the true patterns, and you might need to consider non-linear models (e.g., decision trees, random forests)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature selection issues:\n",

    "Ridge doesn't perform selection: Ridge regression doesn't perform feature selection, so you might end up with a model that includes irrelevant features, increasing complexity and potentially reducing interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tuning hyperparameter challenges:Regularization parameter selection: The effectiveness of regularization depends on the strength of the penalty term. Choosing the right regularization parameter (lambda) can be crucial. A value that's too low might not provide enough regularization, while a value that's too high can lead to underfitting (model is too simple and doesn't capture the data well). Finding the optimal value often involves experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Potential loss of interpretability:\n",
    "Feature selection complexity: With Lasso, feature selection can make the model less interpretable as it's not always clear why certain features were removed. Understanding the relationships between features and the target variable becomes more challenging.\n",

Not a silver bullet:Regularization doesn't guarantee good performance: Even with regularization, other factors like data quality, feature engineering, and model selection can significantly impact performance.
