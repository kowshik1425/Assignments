    "Lasso Regression, also known as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a regression technique with two key functionalities:\n",
    "1. Feature Selection: It automatically selects relevant features from your dataset by shrinking some coefficients to zero.\n",
    "2. Regularization: It prevents overfitting by penalizing large coefficients, resulting in a simpler and more generalizable model.\n",
    "how Lasso compares to other popular regression techniques:\n",
    "Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): Lasso introduces L1 penalty (absolute value of coefficients) unlike squared penalty in OLS. This encourages sparsity, selecting only important features and potentially setting others to zero.\n",
    "Ridge Regression: Both use regularization, but Lasso uses L1 while Ridge uses L2 penalty (squared value of coefficients). L1 leads to sparse models with some coefficients as zero, while L2 shrinks all coefficients towards zero.\n",
    "Decision Trees/Random Forest: These are tree-based methods that inherently perform feature selection, but unlike Lasso, they cannot provide coefficient interpretation due to their non-linear nature.\n",
