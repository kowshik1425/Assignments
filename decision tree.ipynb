Accuracy, a common metric, simply tells you the overall percentage of correct predictions. But it doesn't reveal how the model performs for specific classes, especially in imbalanced datasets. Using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score can provide a more nuanced understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses in identifying different classes.\n",

For example, in a medical diagnosis system, a false negative (missing a disease) could be much more critical than a false positive (mistakenly identifying a disease).  In this case, prioritizing recall (correctly identifying all positive cases) might be more important than accuracy. Choosing the right metric helps guide your decision-making process for model improvement or deployment.\n",

While inconvenient for the customer who might have their card blocked, it doesn't result in financial loss for the bank. The customer can usually verify the transaction and regain access to their card.\n",

A false negative occurs when the system fails to identify a patient who actually has the disease. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, potentially worsening the patient's condition.\n",
    "Impact of False Positives:  While a false positive is not ideal, it's less risky. This happens when the system identifies a patient with the disease when they actually don't have it.  This might lead to unnecessary tests or procedures, but it's generally better than missing the disease altogether. Early detection and intervention are crucial for many diseases.\n",
    "Recall prioritizes minimizing false negatives.  A high recall value in this context indicates that the system successfully identifies a large proportion of patients who actually have the disease. This ensures timely diagnosis and treatment for the majority of patients.\n",

    "Additional Considerations:\n",
    "While recall is crucial, achieving perfect recall might not be feasible.  The model might need to be adjusted to strike a balance between recall and the number of false positives generated.\n",
