    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function of a machine learning model. It's commonly used in scenarios where the goal is to find the optimal parameters (weights and biases) for the model that minimize the error between the predicted and actual values.\n",

    "Multicollinearity occurs in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. This high correlation can lead to issues in the regression analysis, including unstable coefficient estimates and difficulty in interpreting the effects of individual predictors. Here's a breakdown of the concept and methods for detecting and addressing multicollinearity:\n",
    "Concept of Multicollinearity:\n",
    "Multicollinearity arises when there are strong linear relationships between independent variables, meaning that one independent variable can be predicted from the others with a high degree of accuracy.\n",
    "It can make it challenging to isolate the individual effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable, as the effects of correlated variables may be confounded.\n",
    "Multicollinearity does not affect the predictive power of the regression model, but it can lead to imprecise estimates of the coefficients and inflated standard errors.\n",
    "Detection of Multicollinearity:\n",
    "Correlation Matrix: Compute the correlation coefficients between pairs of independent variables. High correlation coefficients (typically above 0.7 or 0.8) indicate potential multicollinearity.\n",
    "Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): Calculate the VIF for each independent variable, which quantifies how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity. VIF values greater than 10 (or sometimes 5) are often considered indicative of multicollinearity.\n",
    "Addressing Multicollinearity:\n",
    "Remove Redundant Variables: If two or more independent variables are highly correlated, consider removing one of them from the model to reduce multicollinearity. Choose the variable that is less theoretically relevant or has lower predictive power.\n",
    "Combine Variables: Create new variables by combining highly correlated variables into composite variables. For example, instead of using both \"height\" and \"weight\" as independent variables, you could create a single variable representing \"body mass index\" (BMI)."
