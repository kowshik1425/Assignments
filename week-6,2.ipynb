    "MongoDB:\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and managing data. Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL databases), which store data in structured tables with rows and columns, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. Each document can have a different structure, allowing for more adaptability to changing data requirements.\n",
    "Non-Relational Databases:\n",
    "Non-relational databases, often referred to as NoSQL databases, are a category of databases that depart from the structured and rigid nature of traditional SQL databases. Instead of using tables, rows, and columns, NoSQL databases employ various data models like key-value, document, columnar, and graph to store and retrieve data. This flexibility makes them suitable for scenarios where data structures are unpredictable or where high scalability and performance are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios Preferred for MongoDB over SQL Databases:\n",
    "Complex Data: MongoDB is a good choice for applications that deal with complex and hierarchical data structures, such as nested arrays and embedded documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is designed to be horizontally scalable, making it well-suited for applications that require high throughput and distributed databases.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Unstructured or Semi-Structured Data: If your data doesn't fit neatly into the rigid rows and columns of a traditional SQL database, MongoDB's document-based approach allows you to store unstructured or semi-structured data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Schema: When your data structure can change frequently or when you need to store different types of data within the same collection, MongoDB's document-based schema is more adaptable."

    "Document-Oriented:\n",
    "MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents known as BSON (Binary JSON). These documents can have varying structures, allowing you to store complex and nested data, making it well-suited for applications with evolving data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Schema:\n",
    "Unlike traditional relational databases with fixed schemas, MongoDB allows you to change the structure of documents without affecting other documents in the collection. This makes it easier to adapt to changing business needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Queries:\n",
    "MongoDB supports dynamic queries using a rich query language. It allows you to query data using fields within documents and supports a wide range of operators for filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary Indexes:\n",
    "MongoDB supports secondary indexes, which enhance query performance by allowing you to index fields other than the primary key. This enables faster data retrieval and filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal Scalability:\n",
    "MongoDB's architecture supports horizontal scaling by distributing data across multiple servers or nodes. This makes it suitable for applications that need to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-Sharding:\n",
    "MongoDB employs an auto-sharding mechanism that automatically distributes data across shards (physical servers or clusters). This ensures even data distribution, improves performance, and enables seamless scaling.\n",
