    "Euclidean Distance: This represents the straight-line distance between two points in n-dimensional space. It uses the Pythagorean theorem to find the square root of the sum of squared differences between corresponding coordinates.\n",

    "Scale Sensitivity:\n",
    "Euclidean Distance: If the features are on different scales, Euclidean distance can be disproportionately influenced by features with larger scales. This can lead to misleading distance calculations unless the data is normalized.\n",
    "Manhattan Distance: Less sensitive to feature scales, making it more robust when features have different ranges. However, normalization can still be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect of Outliers:\n",
    "Euclidean Distance: Squaring the differences makes this metric more sensitive to outliers. A single large difference in any dimension can dominate the distance calculation, potentially leading to poor neighbor selection.\n",
    "Manhattan Distance: By summing absolute differences, Manhattan distance is less affected by outliers, which can make it more robust in noisy datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-Dimensional Data:\n",
    "Euclidean Distance: In high-dimensional spaces, Euclidean distance can become less meaningful because the absolute differences in each dimension are amplified. This phenomenon is part of the \"curse of dimensionality.\"\n",
    "Manhattan Distance: Can be more stable in high-dimensional spaces since it aggregates linear differences, which can mitigate some effects of the curse of dimensionality.\n",

    "Data Structure and Interpretation:\n",
    "Euclidean Distance: Suitable when the data structure is best interpreted as straight-line distances. Commonly used in problems where geometric relationships are important.\n",
    "Manhattan Distance: Suitable for grid-like structures or when the relationships between features are better represented by summing absolute differences. This can be more interpretable in certain applications like urban navigation or text analysis."

    "Computational Efficiency:\n",
    "Large Training Set: As the size of the training set increases, the computational cost of making predictions also increases. KNN requires calculating the distance between the query point and all points in the training set, which can become computationally expensive with large datasets.\n",
    "Small Training Set: While faster to compute, a smaller training set may not provide sufficient information for accurate predictions.\n",

    "KD-Trees or Ball Trees: These data structures can be used to accelerate the nearest neighbor search process, especially for high-dimensional data.\n",
