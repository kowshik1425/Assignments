    "Yes, Ridge Regression can be used for feature selection, although its primary purpose is regularization to handle multicollinearity and prevent overfitting. Unlike ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, Ridge Regression does not exactly zero out coefficients, but it shrinks them towards zero. This shrinkage encourages Ridge Regression to distribute the importance more evenly among correlated features rather than assigning high weights to just one of them.\n",
    "\n",
