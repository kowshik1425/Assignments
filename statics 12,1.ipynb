    "P-value (alternative approach):Although the t-statistic is 0, a more informative approach might be to calculate the p-value directly. The p-value represents the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one we calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "Since the t-statistic is 0 (perfectly centered on the hypothesized mean), the p-value will be 1 (100%). This indicates that observing a t-statistic of 0 (or any value exactly matching the null hypothesis) is entirely expected if caffeine has no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision:Considering both the t-statistic of 0 and the p-value of 1, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. At a 90% confidence level (considering the two-tailed test), the data doesn't provide enough evidence to conclude that caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time in this sample."
