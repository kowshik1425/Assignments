    "GridSearchCV works by exhaustively searching through a specified subset of hyperparameter combinations and evaluating each combination using cross-validation. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the Hyperparameter Grid: You specify a grid of hyperparameters and their possible values. This grid represents all the combinations of hyperparameters that you want to search over.\n",
    "Perform Cross-Validation: GridSearchCV splits the training data into multiple folds (or subsets). For each combination of hyperparameters in the grid, it trains the model on a subset of the data (training fold) and evaluates its performance on a different subset (validation fold). This process is repeated for each fold.\n",
    "Select the Best Hyperparameters: After evaluating all combinations, GridSearchCV selects the combination of hyperparameters that produces the best performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, mean squared error) on the validation folds. The performance metric is typically defined by the user.\n",
    "Retrain the Model: Once the best hyperparameters are identified, GridSearchCV retrains the model on the entire training set using these optimal hyperparameters. This final trained model can then be used for making predictions on new, unseen data."

    "Approach: Grid Search CV exhaustively searches through a specified grid of hyperparameters. It evaluates each combination of hyperparameters using cross-validation and selects the combination that performs the best.\n",
    "Search Space: Grid Search CV explores every possible combination of hyperparameters in the predefined grid. This can be computationally expensive, especially if the search space is large or if there are many hyperparameters with a wide range of values.\n",
    "Use Case: Grid Search CV is suitable when you have a relatively small search space and want to find the best hyperparameters by evaluating all possible combinations. It guarantees finding the optimal hyperparameters within the specified grid.\n",
    "Randomized Search CV:\n",
    "Approach: Randomized Search CV randomly samples from the hyperparameter space. It does not try every possible combination but instead randomly selects a subset of hyperparameter combinations to evaluate.\n",
    "Search Space: Randomized Search CV allows for more flexibility in defining the search space. It can efficiently explore a large hyperparameter space by sampling a finite number of combinations, making it more suitable for high-dimensional or continuous hyperparameter spaces.\n",
    "Use Case: Randomized Search CV is useful when the search space is large or when the number of hyperparameters is high. It may not guarantee finding the optimal solution, but it can provide good results with fewer computations compared to Grid Search CV."

    "Data leakage, also known as leakage or information leakage, refers to the situation where information from outside the training dataset is inadvertently used to make predictions or evaluate model performance.

In other words, the model is using information about the loan outcome that would not be available at the time of making a prediction.\n",
