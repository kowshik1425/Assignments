    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "=>Ordinal Encoding is used when there is an inherent order or ranking among the categories within a categorical feature.\n",
    "=>It assigns a unique integer value to each category, typically starting from 1 and increasing sequentially based on the predefined order or ranking of the categories.\n",
    "=>Ordinal Encoding preserves the ordinal relationship between the categories, which means it captures the notion of \"greater than\" and \"less than\" among the categories.\n",
    "=>It is commonly used for features like education level (e.g., high school < bachelor's < master's < Ph.D.), customer satisfaction (e.g., low < medium < high), or temperature (e.g., cold < warm < hot).\n",

    "Example:\n",

    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "=>Label Encoding is used when there is no inherent order or ranking among the categories, and the categories are nominal (unordered).\n",
    "=>It assigns a unique integer value to each category, similar to Ordinal Encoding, but without any specific order.\n",
    "=>Label Encoding does not capture any meaningful ordinal relationship between categories; it treats all categories as equal.\n",

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to convert categorical variables into ordinal values based on the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable in a supervised machine learning setting. It aims to capture the information about how the categories of a categorical feature are related to the target variable's values. This encoding method can be particularly useful when the categorical variable has a strong influence on the target variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sort the categories based on the calculated mean values in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign ordinal values to the categories based on their position in the sorted order. The category with the highest mean value gets the highest (or lowest) ordinal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate this with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are working on a machine learning project to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. You have a categorical feature \"Contract Type,\" which can take values like \"Month-to-Month,\" \"One Year,\" and \"Two Year,\" representing different types of customer contracts. You want to convert this feature into ordinal values using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding.\n",

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the degree to which two random variables change together. In other words, it quantifies the relationship between two variables and whether they tend to increase or decrease simultaneously. It is an essential concept in statistics and data analysis, as it helps us understand the linear relationship between two variables and can provide insights into how they might be related.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more detailed explanation of covariance and its importance:\n",
    "Covariance:Covariance between two random variables X and Y, denoted as Cov(X, Y), is calculated as the expected value of the product of their deviations from their respective means. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cov(X, Y) = E[(X - μX) * (Y - μY)]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "X and Y are the random variables.\n",
    "μX and μY are the means (expected values) of X and Y, respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "Importance of Covariance in Statistical Analysis:\n",
    "Covariance serves several important purposes in statistical analysis:\n",
    "a. Relationship Assessment: Covariance helps determine whether two variables tend to move in the same direction  or in opposite directions. A positive covariance indicates a positive relationship, while a negative covariance suggests a negative relationship.\n",
    "b. Scaling Independence: Covariance is not scaled, which makes it challenging to compare the strength of the relationship between variables. To address this, another metric called the correlation coefficient is often used, which is derived from covariance and provides a standardized measure of the relationship strength between variables."
